###
## Part I: In-class problems (solutions available)

## Problem 1: Create a 4 by 4 matrix containing integer elements
##   a) Retrieve the second column
##   b) Retrieve the third row
##   c) Retrieve all odd elements in the matrix
##      (Hint: n %% 2 is equal to 1 for odd n and equal to zero for even n)

## Problem 2: Use a for loop to add up the first five non-zero perfect squares
##      (Hint: 1^2 = 1 and 2^2 = 4 are the first two non-zero perfect squares)

## Problem 3: Using the data included with R called mtcars
data(mtcars)
##   a) Compute the mean mpg of all 4-cylinder vehicles
##   b) Count the number of vehicles per cylinder size


###
## Part II: Take-home problems (no solutions given)

## Problem 1: Create a 4 by 4 matrix containing character elements
##            of lenghts varying between 3 and 5 characters
##   a) Retrieve all elements strictly more than 3 characters long
##      (Hint: nchar(x) returns the number of characters in the character variable x)

## Problem 2: Use the functions Map and Reduce (and no loops)
##            to add up the first five non-zero perfect squares
